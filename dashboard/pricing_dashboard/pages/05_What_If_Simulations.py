###  What is this?
These simulations use a regression model to predict the impact of **discount rate** and **average order value (AOV)** changes on `avg_profit_per_order` across regions.

The model was trained using historical data and key features, yielding:
- **RÂ² Score**: `0.9976` (excellent predictive power)
- **MSE**: `49.04`

### ðŸ“ˆ Strategic Summary

- The regression model enables us to simulate profitability under hypothetical pricing strategies.
- **Increasing AOV by $10** consistently shows uplift in avg profit per order across most regions.
- **Reducing discount rate by 5%** is beneficial in high-discount regions, but may reduce conversions elsewhere.
- Managers can test pricing levers before rollout, using this predictive tool to minimize risk.
